## 🧩 Overview

**Sami3 (سَمِعْ)** is a curated discovery platform for Arabic-language podcasts. It helps users locate content based on dialect, region, and topic — while providing creators with tools to reach their audience more effectively.

As Arabic podcasts expand across genres and regions, listeners face a fragmented and generic experience. Sami3 addresses this by personalising podcast discovery and organising shows in a culturally and linguistically meaningful way.

## 🔍 Discovery

### Objective: Understand the needs of Arabic-speaking podcast listeners and creators

- Interviewed 20+ listeners from the Gulf, Levant, Egypt, and North Africa
- Engaged 8 independent Arabic podcast creators

### Key Insights:
- Users sought content that reflected **their dialect**, region, and interests
- Most platforms grouped all dialects under generic “Arabic” labels
- Creators lacked tools for visibility or audience feedback

### Jobs to Be Done:
> “When I want to listen to podcasts, I want to find shows in my dialect and on topics I care about so I don’t waste time on irrelevant content.”  
> “As a podcast creator, I want to tag and submit my content properly, so I can reach the right audience and grow.”
